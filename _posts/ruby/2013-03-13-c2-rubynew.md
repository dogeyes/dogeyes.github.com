# chapter2 Ruby.new

## Ruby Is an Object-Oriented Language

Everything you manipulate is an object, and the results of those manipulations are themselves objects.

A class is a combination of **state** and **methods** that use that state

**instances** of classes

The word **object** is used interchangeably with class instance

**constructor** **new**

song1 = Song.new("Ruby Tuesday")

* every object has a unique *object identifier*
* you can define *instance variables*
* you can define *instance methods*

Methods are invoked by sending a message to an object. The message contains the method’s name, along with any parameters the method may need.

{% highlight ruby %}
"gin joint".length → 9
"Rick".index("c") → 2
-1942.abs → 1942
{% endhighlight %}

the thing before the period is called the *receiver*, and the name after the period is the method to be invoked.

## Some Basic Ruby

{% highlight ruby %}
def say_goodnight(name)
  result = "Good night, " + name
  return result
end
# Time for bed...
puts say_goodnight("John-Boy")
puts(say_goodnight("Mary-Ellen")) #the same
{% endhighlight %}

`#` for comment

**no semicolons** at the ends of statements

`def` define method

`end` finish the body

using parentheses in all but the simplest cases

string: sequences of characters between *single* or *double* quotation marks.

* In the single-quoted case, Ruby does very little. With a few exceptions, what you type into the string literal becomes the string’s value.
* In the double-quoted case, Ruby does more work. 
	1. First, it looks for substitutions sequences that start with a backslash character—and replaces them with some binary value.  `\n`
	2. The second thing that Ruby does with double-quoted strings is expression interpolation.Within the string, the sequence `#{expression}` is replaced by the value of expression.

{% highlight ruby %}
def say_goodnight(name)
  result = "Good night, #{name.capitalize}"
  return result
end
puts say_goodnight('uncle')
{% endhighlight %}

As a shortcut, you don’t need to supply the braces when the expression is simply a global, instance, or class variable

{% highlight ruby %}
$greeting = "Hello" # $greeting is a global variable
@name = "Prudence" # @name is an instance variable
puts "#$greeting, #@name"
{% endhighlight %}

The value returned by a Ruby method is the value of the last expression evaluated ,so we can get rid of the temporary
variable and the return statement altogether.

{% highlight ruby %}
def say_goodnight(name)
  "Good night, #{name.capitalize}"
end
puts say_goodnight('uncle')
{% endhighlight %}

### something about name

Ruby uses a convention to help it distinguish the usage of a name: the first characters of a name indicate how the name is used.

* **Local** variables,method parameters,and method names should all start with a lowercase letter or with an underscore.
* **Global variables** are prefixed with a dollar sign ($)
* **Global instance** variables begin with an “at” sign (@).
* **Class variables** start with two “at” signs (@@).
* **class names**, **module names**, and **constants** must start with an uppercase letter.
* **multiword instances variables** are written with underscores between the words
* **multiword class** names are written in MixedCase

## Arrays and Hashes

Ruby’s arrays and hashes are indexed collections.

**arrays**: the key is an integer, more efficient

**hashes**: support any object as a key, more flexibility

Both arrays and hashes grow as needed to hold new elements.

Any particular array or hash can hold objects of differing types; you can have an array containing an integer, a string, and a floating-point number

#### array

create and initialize a new array object using an array literal

{% highlight ruby %}
a = [ 1, 'cat', 3.14 ] # array with three elements
a[2] = nil
{% endhighlight %}

`nil` means "no object" in other languages

`nil` is an object in ruby, represent nothing

{% highlight ruby %}
a = [ 'ant', 'bee', 'cat', 'dog', 'elk' ]
# this is the same:
a = %w{ ant bee cat dog elk }  # %w
{% endhighlight %}

#### hash `=>`

{% highlight ruby %}
inst_section = {
  'cello' => 'string',
  'clarinet' => 'woodwind',
  'drum' => 'percussion',
  'oboe' => 'woodwind',
  'trumpet' => 'brass',
  'violin' => 'string'
}

inst_section['oboe'] → "woodwind"
inst_section['cello'] → "string"
inst_section['bassoon'] → nil # returns nil when key doesn't contain
{% endhighlight %}

Keys in a particular hash must be unique

`nil` means false when used in conditional expressions

Sometimes you’ll want to change this default. Forexample,ifyou’re
using a hash to count the number of times each key occurs, it’s convenient to have the default value be zero.

{% highlight ruby %}
histogram = Hash.new(0) # change the default value
histogram['key1'] → 0
histogram['key1'] = histogram['key1'] + 1
histogram['key1'] → 1
{% endhighlight %}

## Control Structures ##

Ruby uses the keyword end to signify the end of a body.

{% highlight ruby %}
if count > 10
  puts "Try again"
elsif tries == 3
  puts "You lose"
else
  puts "Enter a number"
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
while weight < 100 and num_pallets <= 30
  pallet = next_pallet()
  weight += pallet.weight
  num_pallets += 1
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
while line = gets
  puts line.downcase
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
if radiation > 3000
  puts "Danger, Will Robinson"
end

# rewritten
puts "Danger, Will Robinson" if radiation > 3000
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
square = 2
while square < 1000
  square = square*square
end
# rewritten
square = 2
square = square*square while square < 1000
{% endhighlight %}

## Regular Expressions

In Ruby, you typically create a regular expression by writing a pattern between slash characters (/pattern/).

{% highlight ruby %}
/Perl|Python/
/P(erl|ython)/
/ab+c/
/ab*c/
\s #for space 
\d #for digit
\w #for letter
.  #for any character
/\d\d:\d\d:\d\d/
/Perl.*Python/
/Perl Python/
/Perl*Python/
/Perl +Python/
/Perl\s+Python/
/Ruby (Perl|Python)/
{% endhighlight %}

The match operator `=~` can be used to match a string against a regular expression. 

If the pattern is found in the string, =~ returns its starting position, otherwise it returns nil.

{% highlight ruby %}
if line =~ /Perl|Python/
  puts "Scripting language mentioned: #{line}" 
end
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
line.sub(/Perl/, 'Ruby') # replace first 'Perl' with 'Ruby'
line.gsub(/Python/, 'Ruby') # replace every 'Python' with 'Ruby'
{% endhighlight %}

## Blocks and Iterators

Code blocks are just chunks of code between braces or between do...end.

{% highlight ruby %}
{ puts "Hello" }

do
club.enroll(person)
person.socialize
end
{% endhighlight %}

braces for single-line blocks and do/end for multiline blocks.(advice)

{% highlight ruby %}
verbose_greet("Dave", "loyal customer") { puts "Hi" }
# parameters comes first, then the block
{% endhighlight %}

**yield**

{% highlight ruby %}
def call_block
  puts "Start of method"
  yield
  yield  #execute the block { puts "In the block" }
  puts "End of method"
end
call_block { puts "In the block" }
{% endhighlight %}

You can provide parameters to the call to yield

{% highlight ruby %}
def call_block
  yield("hello", 99)
end
call_block {|str, num| ... } #|receive parameters|
{% endhighlight %}

**iterators** implemented by **code blocks**

{% highlight ruby %}
animals = %w( ant bee cat dog elk )
animals.each {|animal| puts animal }
{% endhighlight %}

In pseudo-code, the each iterator may look like
{% highlight ruby %}
# within class Array...
def each
  for each element # <-- not valid Ruby
    yield(element)
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Many of the looping constructs that are built into languages such as C and Java are simply method calls in Ruby, with the methods invoking the associated block zero or more times.

{% highlight ruby %}
[ 'cat', 'dog', 'horse' ].each {|name| print name, " " }
5.times {print "*" }
3.upto(6) {|i| print i }
('a'..'e').each {|char| print char }
{% endhighlight %}

## Reading and Writing

`puts` newline

`print` no new line

`printf` C like

`gets`
